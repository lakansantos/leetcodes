This repository is a collection of my coding solutions, notes, and experiments from LeetCode and other coding platforms.
It serves as a personal archive of problem-solving approaches, algorithmic patterns, and code snippets I‚Äôve worked on while practicing data structures, algorithms, and general programming concepts.

üõ†Ô∏è Purpose

Document solutions to LeetCode problems.

Keep track of progress and improvements over time.

Store code experiments and small changes while exploring different approaches.

Serve as a personal reference for future problem-solving.

üöÄ Notes

This repository is for personal learning and practice purposes only.
Code quality may vary depending on whether the solution was a first attempt, optimized approach, or experimental version.
